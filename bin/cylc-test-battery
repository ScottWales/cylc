USAGE: cylc test-battery [OPTIONS] [FILES or DIRECTORIES] -- [prove OPTIONS]

Run automated cylc and parsec tests under [FILES or DIRECTORIES].
Test locations default to the following directory trees:
  $CYLC_DIR/tests/
and
  $CYLC_DIR/lib/parsec/tests/

Some tests (e.g. those specific to particular batch schedulers) can be
configured in your site/user config file. A few others still submit jobs
to a user@host account taken from the environment:
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST # default localhost
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_OWNER # defaut \$USER

Requirements:
  * Passwordless ssh must be configured to task host accounts.
  * Some test suites submit jobs to 'at' so atd must be running.

Suite run directories are cleaned up on the suite host (but not on
remote task hosts) for passing tests - otherwise they are left alone.

By default $N tests are run at once, in parallel. On slow or loaded
machines this may result in some test failures due to timeouts intended
to catch problems that can prevent a suite from shutting down normally.
Use the "-j N" option to change the amount of concurrency.

To output stderr from failed tests to the terminal, export
CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true before running this command. To perform comparison
tests using `xxdiff -D`, export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG_CMP=true.

For more information see "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.

Options after '--' are passed through to "prove".
E.g. to run N tests at once, in parallel (default $N):
  cylc test-battery -- -j N      
eof
