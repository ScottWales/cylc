"""cylc [control] ext-trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Report an external event message to a suite daemon. It is expected that a
task in the suite has registered the same message as an external trigger - a
special prerequisite to be satisifed by an external system, via this command,
rather than by triggering off other tasks.

The ID argument should uniquely distinguish one external trigger event from the
next. When a task's external trigger is satisfied by an incoming message, the
message ID is broadcast to all downstream tasks in the cycle point as
$CYLC_EXT_TRIGGER_ID so that they can use it - e.g. to identify a new data file
that the external triggering system is responding to.

Use the retry options in case the target suite is down or out of contact.

The suite passphrase must be installed in $HOME/.cylc/<SUITE>/.

Note: to manually trigger a task use 'cylc trigger', not this command."""
