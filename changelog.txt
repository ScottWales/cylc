CYLC METASCHEDULER CHANGE LOG, INITIALIZED after version 3.0.3.

Non-trivial changes of relevance to users are listed. All changes are
likely to involve unlisted minor updates and corrections to cylc 
documentation (User Guide, command line help, and GUI help).

Version number X.Y.Z incrementing:
  X - major changes
  Y - significant changes
  Z - minor changes and bug fixes

3.0.4
 + More documentation of error detection in task scripts.
 + 'cylc admin create-cdb' now uses its own test suite.

3.0.5
 + Clarified graph-based control GUI help.

3.1.0
 + Allow use of lockserver in simulation mode.
 + New suite compare/diff functionality added.

3.2.0
 + Big speed up for large suites due to some optimization of the
   scheduling algorithm.
 + Monospaced fonts in GUI output capture windows.

3.3.0
 + Updated the terminal monitor to display held (paused) tasks properly.
 + Entirely eliminated the need for explicit task wrapping:
   - moved 'task started' and 'task succeeded' messages, and automatic
   'task failed' messaging, to the generated task job script.
   - task scripts now only have to call 'task succeeded/failed', and
     only for tasks whose initiating processes detach and exit early.
   - this means the entire task job script is now seen by cylc, not just 
     the (formerly) wrapped command line.
   - task-specific pre-command scripting is no longer needed - instead
     the task command string can contain multiline scripting.
 + New variable $CYLC_SUITE_ENVIRONMENT in the task execution environment
   for use in custom wrappers for tasks with manual completion messaging.
 + Added and documented new example suite to illustrate custom task wrapping.

3.3.1
 + Fixed a typo in writing out the new $CYLC_SUITE_ENVIRONMENT to job
 scripts, which could break new-style custom wrappers for detaching tasks. 

3.3.2
 + Fixed a bug introduced at 3.2.0 that prevented failed tasks from 
   becoming 'unfailed' after retriggering them.

3.3.3
 + Full path configuration for suite state dump and log directories.
 + Fixed recently introduced bug affecting loadleveler job submission: an
   executable statement appeared before the directives in task job scripts.

3.3.4
 + Autogenerated HTML version of the User Guide added.
 + Fixed a bug introduced at 3.3.2 affecting suite warm starts:
   - a misspelled function call in bin/_run caused suite warm starts to fail.
 + Fixed a bug introduced at 3.3.3 affecting detached tasks in simulation mode:
   -  Since eliminating 'cylc wrap' tasks that handle their own
      completion messaging in real mode need automatic completion in sim mode.  
 + Documented local installation of Pyro, Graphviz, and Pygraphviz.
 + Documented how to upgrade to a new version of cylc.
