            <p class="p1"><span>Cylc (<em>"silk"</em>) is an advanced
                metascheduler that makes it easy to construct and
                control flexible, portable suites for cycling

                Cylc suites optimally interleave tasks from multiple

   <p class="p1"><span> Cylc is developed by Dr Hilary James Oliver at
        <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">NIWA</a> 
        (National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research,
        New Zealand). It was prototyped in 2008, has controlled NIWA's
        multi-model operational forecasting systems since 2010, and was
        released under the GNU General Public License in 2011.</span></p>

    <a id="overview"></a>
    <h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span>A metascheduler, in this context, is a
        <em>control system</em>
        that determines when members of a suite of interdependent tasks
        are ready to execute (usually by submission to a batch queue
        scheduler). Cylc does this for suites of <em>cycling</em> tasks.
        </span></p>
        
    <p class="p2"><span>
        Dependence between tasks in different forecast cycles can
        be ignored in real time operation, but this severely
        restricts scheduling after delays when it should be
        possible to run tasks from multiple cycles at once. Even  
        <a href="intro/dep-one-cycle.png">simple suites</a> appear
        <a href="intro/dep-multi-cycle.png">complicated</a>
        when intercycle dependence is taken into account (a, b, and c
        represent warm-cycled forecast models). Cylc's self-organising
        scheduling algorithm solves this problem, and as a result it can
        optimally interleave tasks from multiple forecast cycles
        whenever the opportunity arises, potentially achieving 
        <a href="intro/timeline-three.png">very fast catch up from delays</a> 
        (cylc on top) even in resource limited operations with little
        down time between cycles. The same goes for
        <a href="intro/timeline-two.png">processing historical data</a>
        (cylc on top) or running parallel test suites that start behind
        the main operation.
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc also has very flexible, adaptive run time behaviour:
        suites naturally transition between delayed and real time
        operation as required; they adapt to insertion and removal of
        tasks; and they flow around failed or delayed tasks (which
        catch up as quickly as possible once the problem is addressed).
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's suite design paradigm is simple and intuitive: 
        "draw" a dependency graph in concise textual form, then
        configure the execution environment and command line for each
        task. This simple 
        <a href="screenshots/simple-suiterc.png">suite definition</a>,
        for example, defines a suite with this
<a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">dependency graph</a>.
        Large suites <a href="screenshots/ecox-1.png">like this</a> are
        no more difficult, they just have more tasks.

			<h3><span>Other Notable Features</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>First, see the <a href="#overview">Overview</a> above.</span></p>
				<ul>
                        <li> Cylc can handle many 
                        hundreds of tasks in a single suite (see 
                        <a href="#performance">performance)</a>.</li>

                        <li> Tasks can be distributed across multiple
                        hosts on a heterogeneous network, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> Most existing models and processing jobs
                        can be used without modification as cylc
                        tasks; some require minimal modification.</li>

            <li>Suite definitions are automatically validated against a
            comprehensive spec file, to catch most errors prior to run time.</li>
	
						<li> Self-documenting command line interface
                        covering all functionality from suite editing to
                        suite control.</li>

						<li> Graphical interfaces covering the same, including 
                        a graph-based suite control interface. See 
                        <a href="#screenshots">screen shots</a>.</li>

                        <li> Cryptographic suite security: users cannot 
                        intervene in the operation of suites owned by others.</li>

                        <li> Run single tasks exactly as the suite would
                        run them (job submission method and execution environment).</li>

						<li> Network lockservers prevent accidental invocation 
                        of multiple instances of the same suite or task
                        at the same time.</li>

						<li> Suite databases enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

                        <li> Insertion and deletion of tasks at run time.</li>

                        <li> Explicit 
                        <a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">cold start processing</a>
                        to bootstrap warm-cycling suites from scratch.</li>

                        <li> Suites can be cold started, warm started, or restarted 
                        from a previous state.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of
						operation.</li>

                        <li> Restart states are automatically dumped prior to 
                        actioning any intervention in a running suite.</li>

                        <li> Spin-up processing by insertion
                        of temporary tasks and addition of new 
                        prerequisites on the fly.</li>

                        <li> Recursive purge: remove an entire sub-tree
                        of tasks through to some future cycle time.</li>

                        <li> Conditional prerequisites (triggers).</li>

                        <li> Task families.</li>

                        <li> Task retry for automated failure recovery.</li>

                        <li> Central alerting and timeouts for operational suites.</li>

                        <li> Portable suites are easy to construct -
                        just copy another user's suite and run it.</li>

                        <li> Simulation mode: get the scheduling right,
                        on an accelerated clock, without running 
                        real tasks.</li>

				</ul>

			<h4><span>Coming Soon</span></h4>
				<ul>
						<li> Central suite database access via a network server. </li>
                        <li> Tasks with cycling intervals of less than 1 hour 
                        (in development).</li>
						<li> Asynchronous tasks for processing satellite passes 
						(back-port from prototype in cylc-2).
						</li>
                        <li> Loose prerequisites: trigger off the "most
                        recent available" (variable offset) instance of
                        a slower-cycling upstream task (back-port from
                        cylc-2).</li>

				<h3 class="foo"><span>Performance</span></h3>

                <p class="p2">As of version 3.2.0 cylc can easily manage
                1000 tasks in single suite. Beyond several hundred tasks
                the suite control GUIs may struggle - they have not yet
                been optimized for huge suites; for now you can run very
                large suites using cylc command line control and
                monitoring tools.</p>

Python and Pyro are essential. PyGTK is required by the gcylc GUI
(but you can control and monitor cylc suites from the command line). 
Graphviz and pygraphviz are required for dependency graphing and the
graph-based suite control GUI (but you can also run cylc without them).

            <h3><span>Development</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>
                Cylc uses the powerful <a href="git-scm.com">Git</a>
                distributed source code management system.  Git makes
                branching and merging, forking/cloning, and pushing and
                pulling changes between repositories very easy. The 
                <a href="http://github.com/hjoliver/cylc">cylc master repository</a> 
                is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
            </span></p>

            <p class="p2"><span>
                At this stage we envision using the 
                <em>fork and pull</em> model
            of collaborative development. Anyone can fork the cylc 
            repository on GitHub (or just locally) and push changes to
            their personal fork (or just work in their local clone)
            without requiring write access to the master repository. The
            changes must then be pulled into the
            source repository, reviewed, and merged, by the project
            maintainer. Thus we avoid the overhead, and potential problems, 
            of managing permissions for multiple users and many personal
            branches within the one repository, and without restricting
            development (because everyone gets their own fully
            functional cylc repository).
            </span></p>

            <p class="p3"><span>
                Ultimately, to reduce the burden of maintainance on the
                master repository, we could have a top tier of official
                forks that the project maintainer collaborates with 
                directly, and others below, perhaps within specific cylc
                sites, that interact with the official collaborators. 
                (But note that if circumstances warrant, anybody can
                easily and safely collaborate with anybody else using
                git, given read access to their respective repositories).
            </span></p>

            <!--
            <p class="p3"><span>
                Finally, note that it is not strictly necessary for
                collaborators to fork cylc on github, it just makes life easier.
