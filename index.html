            <p class="p1"><span>Cylc (<em>"silk"</em>) is an advanced
                metascheduler that makes it easy to construct and
                control flexible, portable suites for cycling 
                weather and environmental forecasting systems, and

                Cylc suites optimally interleave tasks from multiple
                forecast cycles for fast catch up from delays, fast
                case studies, and fast offset parallel test suites.

			<h3><span>Provenance</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span> Cylc is developed by Dr Hilary James Oliver at
        NIWA (the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research,
        New Zealand). It was prototyped in 2008, has controlled NIWA's
        multi-model operational forecasting systems since 2010, and was
        released under the GNU General Public License in 2011.</span></p>

    <h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span>A metascheduler (in this context) is a 
        <em>control system</em> that decides when
        members of a suite of inter-dependent tasks are <em>ready</em>
        to be submitted to a batch scheduler to be queued for execution.
        Cylc manages <em>cycling</em> (repeating) tasks related in terms
        of their respective forecast <em>cycle times</em>.
        </scan></p>
        
    <p class="p2"><span>
        Dependence between tasks in different forecast cycles can
        usually be ignored in real time operation, but this severely
        restricts scheduling in delayed operation when it should be
        possible to run tasks from multiple cycles at once. Even  
        <a href="intro/dep-one-cycle.png">simple suites</a> become
        <a href="intro/dep-multi-cycle.png">complicated</a>
        when inter-cycle dependence is taken into account (in the
        illustrations a, b, and c are warm-cycled forecast models).  
    </scan></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's self-organizing scheduling algorithm addresses this
        problem and does not use global cycling mechanisms to advance
        in time. This allows optimal interleaving of tasks from
        multiple forecast cycles, potentially achieving 
        very fast catch up from delays even in resource limited
        operations with little down time between cycles
        (as shown 
        <a href="intro/timeline-three.png">here</a> above the time line 
        for the example of the previous paragraph). 
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc also has very flexible, adaptive run time behaviour:
        suites organically transition between delayed and real time
        operation as required; they adapt to insertion and removal of
        tasks; and they flow around failed or delayed tasks - which
        catch up as quickly as possible once the problem is addressed.</span></p>
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's suite design paradigm is simple and intuitive: 
        "draw" a dependency graph in concise textual form, then
        configure the execution environment and command line for each
        task. E.g.: the <em>dependencies</em> section in 
        <a href="screenshots/simple-suiterc.png">this suite definition</a> 
        defines <a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">this suite</a>.

			<h3><span>Other Notable Features</span></h3>
				<ul>
                        <li> Tasks can be distributed across multiple
                        hosts on a heterogeneous network, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> Most existing models and processing jobs
                        can be used without modification as cylc
                        tasks; some require minimal modification.</li>

            <li>Suite definitions are automatically validated against a
            comprehensive spec file, to catch most errors prior to run time.</li>
	
						<li> Self-documenting unified command line interface
						covering all functionality from suite editing,
						searching, graphing, and validation; to 
						interrogation and control.</li>

						<li> Graphical interfaces covering the same, including 
						a graph-based suite control interface. See screen shots.</li>

                        <li> Cryptographic suite security to prevent users from 
                        intervening in the operation of suites owned by others.</li>

                        <li> Run single tasks exactly as the suite would
                        run them (job submission method and execution environment).</li>

						<li> A network lockserver prevents accidental invocation 
						of multiple instances of the same suite or task at the same
						time.</li>

						<li> Suite databases enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

                        <li> Insertion and deletion of tasks at run time.</li>

                        <li> Explicit handling of cold start processing to 
                        bootstrap warm-cycling suites from scratch.</li>

                        <li> Suites can be cold started, warm started, or restarted 
                        from a previous state.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of
						operation.</li>

                        <li> Restart states are automatically dumped prior to 
                        actioning any intervention in a running suite.</li>

                        <li> Spin-up processing by insertion
                        of temporary tasks and addition of new 
                        prerequisites on the fly.</li>

                        <li> Recursive purge: remove an entire sub-tree
                        of tasks through to some future cycle time.

                        <li> Conditional prerequisites.</li>

                        <li> Task families.</li>

                        <li> Task retry for automated failure recovery.</li>

                        <li> Central alerting and timeouts for operational suites.</li>

                        <li> Portable suites can easily be constructed
                        (no hardwired paths for suite control files or
                        output directories, etc. - just copy a suite and
                        run it).</li>

                        <li> Simulation mode: get the scheduling right,
                        on an accelerated clock, without running 
                        real tasks.</li>

				</ul>

			<h4><span>Coming Soon</span></h4>
				<ul>
						<li> Central suite database access via a network server. </li>
                        <li> Tasks with cycling intervals of less than 1 hour 
                        (in development).</li>
						<li> Asynchronous tasks for processing satellite passes 
						(back-port from prototype in cylc-2).
						</li>
                        <li> Loose prerequisites: trigger off the "most
                        recent available" (variable offset) instance of
                        a slower-cycling upstream task (back-port from
                        cylc-2).</li>

                        <li> Initiate and populate the GitHub cylc repository issue tracker.</li>

            <h3><span>Development</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>
                Cylc uses the powerful Git distributed source code management system. 
              The master repository is <a href="http://github.com/hjoliver/cylc">here</a> on GitHub.
            </span></p>

            <p class="p2"><span>
                At this stage the collaborative development model is envisioned as follows.
                Collaborators should:
                <ul>
                    <li> Clone the cylc master repository on GitHub.</li>
                    <li> Develop new features in a new branch of their own repository.</li>
                    <li> Finally, merge in any new changes from the master repository, and,</li>
                    <li> Send a pull request to the master repository maintainer.</li>
                </ul>
                The master repository maintainer can then pull the new branch, review the changes,
                and merge into the main branch for future releases.
            </span></p>

            <p class="p3"><span>
                This model applies specifically to the top tier of cylc
                developers who need to interact directly with the
                master cylc repository. There can be lower tiers of
                development, within a particular organisation
                say, that work similarly below the top collaborator
                repositories.
