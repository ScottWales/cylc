            <p class="p1"><span>Cylc (<em>"silk"</em>) is an advanced
                metascheduler that makes it easy to construct and
                control powerful, portable, suites for cycling 
                weather and environmental forecasting systems.</span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span>.</span></p>

			<h3><span>Provenance</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span> Cylc is developed by Dr Hilary James Oliver at
        NIWA (the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research,
        New Zealand). It was first prototyped in 2008, has been used to
        run NIWA's operational forecasting systems since 2010, and in
        2011 was released as free open source software under the terms
        of the GNU General Public License.</span></p>

    <h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span>Cylc decides when members of a suite of
        inter-dependent cycling tasks are ready to be submitted to a
        scheduler to be queued for execution.
    </scan></p>
        
    <p class="p2"><span>
        Dependence between forecast cycles can usually be ignored
        in real time operation, but this places severe restrictions on
        catchup/delayed operation when it should be possible to run
        tasks from multiple cycles at once. Even simple suites <a
            href="intro/dep-one-cycle.png">like this one</a> become
        complicated <a href="intro/dep-multi-cycle.png">like this</a>
        when intercycle dependence is taken into account (a, b, and c
        are warm-cycled forecast models).  
    </scan></p>


    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's self-organizing scheduling algorithm explicitly manages
        dependencies between as well as within forecast cycles, allowing
        it to optimally interleave tasks from multiple cycles without
        dependency violations, potentially achieving very fast catchup
        from delays even in resource limited operations with little down
        time between cycles - as shown in
        <a href="intro/timeline-three.png">this job schedule</a> (cylc
        is above the time line).         
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc also has very flexible and adaptive run time behaviour.        
        Suites organically transition between delayed and real time
        operation as required; they adapt to insertion and removal of
        tasks; and they flow around failed or delayed tasks
        while problems are addressed - after which the delayed tasks
        catch up as quickly as possible.</span></p>

			<h3><span>Notable Features</span></h3>
				<ul>
                        <li> Tasks can be distributed across multiple
                        heterogeneous hosts, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> Most existing models and processing jobs
                        can be used without modification as cylc
                        tasks.</li>

                        <li>Simple, structured, intuitive suite
                        definition: "draw"
                        a dependency graph in concise textual form, and
                        configure the execution environment and command
                        line for each task.

            <li>Suite definitions are automatically validated against a
            comprehensive spec file, to catch most errors prior to run time.</li>
	
						<li> Self-documenting unified command line interface
						covering all functionality from suite editing,
						searching, graphing, and validation; to 
						interrogation and control.</li>

						<li> Graphical interfaces covering the same, including 
						a graph-based suite control interface. See screen shots.</li>

                        <li> Cryptographic suite security to prevent users from 
                        intervening in the operation of suites owned by others.</li>

                        <li> Run single tasks exactly as the suite would
                        run them (job submission method and execution environment) </li>

						<li> A network lockserver prevents accidental invocation 
						of multiple instances of the same suite or task at the same
						time.</li>

						<li> Suite databases enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

                        <li> Insertion and deletion of tasks at run time</li>

                        <li> Explicit handling of cold start processing to 
                        bootstrap warm-cycling suites from scratch.</li>

                        <li> Suites can be cold started, warm started, or restarted 
                        from a previous state.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of
						operation.</li>

                        <li> Restart states are automtically dumped prior to 
                        actioning any intervention in a running suite.</li>

                        <li> In-suite spin-up processing via insertion
                        of temporary tasks and addition of temporary
                        prequisites on the fly.</li>

                        <li> Recursive purge: remove an entire sub-tree
                        of tasks through to some future cycle time.

                        <li> Conditional prerequisites </li>

                        <li> Task families </li>

                        <li> Task retry for automated failure recovery </li>

                        <li> Central alerting and timeouts for operational suites </li>

                        <li> Portable suites: just copy and run</li>

                        <li> Simulation mode: get the scheduling right,
                        on an accelerated clock, without running 
                        real tasks</li>

				</ul>

			<h3><span>Coming Soon</span></h3>
				<ul>
						<li> Central suite database access via a network server </li>
                        <li> Tasks with cycling intervals of less than 1 hour 
                        (in development)</li>
						<li> Asynchronous tasks for processing satellite passes 
						(back-port from prototype in cylc-2).
						</li>
                        <li> Loose prerequisites allowing use of "most recent 
                        available" outputs from slower-cycling upstream tasks
						(back-port from cylc-2).</li>

                        <li> Initiate and popuplate the cylc repository issue tracker.</li>
