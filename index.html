            <p class="p1"><span>Cylc (<em>"silk"</em>) is an advanced
                metascheduler that makes it easy to construct and
                control flexible, portable suites for cycling 
                weather and environmental forecasting systems, and 
                related data processing.

        <p class="p2"><span>-->
                Cylc suites optimally interleave tasks from multiple
                forecast cycles for fast catch up from delays, fast
                case studies, and fast offset parallel test suites.

			<h3><span>Provenance</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span> Cylc is developed by Dr Hilary James Oliver at
        <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">NIWA</a> 
        (National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research,
        New Zealand). It was prototyped in 2008, has controlled NIWA's
        multi-model operational forecasting systems since 2010, and was
        released under the GNU General Public License in 2011.</span></p>

    <a id="overview"></a>
    <h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span>A metascheduler controls the order in which
        members of a suite of inter-dependent tasks are executed
        (usually by submission to a batch queue scheduler) in order to
        avoid dependency violations. Cylc does this for suites
        of <em>cycling</em> tasks.
        </scan></p>
        
    <p class="p2"><span>
        Dependence between tasks in different forecast cycles can
        usually be ignored in real time operation. This severely
        restricts scheduling after delays when it should be
        possible to run tasks from multiple cycles at once - but even  
        <a href="intro/dep-one-cycle.png">simple suites</a> become
        <a href="intro/dep-multi-cycle.png">complicated</a>
        when inter-cycle dependence is taken into account (in the
        illustrations a, b, and c represent warm-cycled forecast models).  
    </scan></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc solves this problem; it optimally interleaves tasks from
        multiple forecast cycles whenever the opportunity arises,
        potentially achieving 
        <a href="intro/timeline-three.png">very fast catch up from delays</a> 
        even in resource limited operations with little down time
        between cycles. The same occurs for processing historical data,
        or running parallel test suites that start behind the main
        operation.
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc also has very flexible, adaptive run time behaviour:
        suites naturally transition between delayed and real time
        operation as required; they adapt to insertion and removal of
        tasks; and they flow around failed or delayed tasks (which
        catch up as quickly as possible once the problem is addressed).</span></p>
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's suite design paradigm is simple and intuitive: 
        "draw" a dependency graph in concise textual form, then
        configure the execution environment and command line for each
        task. E.g.: this simple 
        <a href="screenshots/simple-suiterc.png">suite definition</a> 
        results in 
<a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">this dependency graph</a>.

			<h3><span>Other Notable Features</span></h3>
				<ul>
                        <li> Tasks can be distributed across multiple
                        hosts on a heterogeneous network, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> Most existing models and processing jobs
                        can be used without modification as cylc
                        tasks; some require minimal modification.</li>

            <li>Suite definitions are automatically validated against a
            comprehensive spec file, to catch most errors prior to run time.</li>
	
						<li> Self-documenting command line interface
                        covering all functionality from suite editing to
                        suite control.</li>

						<li> Graphical interfaces covering the same, including 
						a graph-based suite control interface. See screen shots.</li>

                        <li> Cryptographic suite security: users cannot 
                        intervene in the operation of suites owned by others.</li>

                        <li> Run single tasks exactly as the suite would
                        run them (job submission method and execution environment).</li>

						<li> Network lockservers prevent accidental invocation 
                        of multiple instances of the same suite or task
                        at the same time.</li>

						<li> Suite databases enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

                        <li> Insertion and deletion of tasks at run time.</li>

                        <li> Explicit 
                        <a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">cold start processing</a>
                        to bootstrap warm-cycling suites from scratch.</li>

                        <li> Suites can be cold started, warm started, or restarted 
                        from a previous state.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of
						operation.</li>

                        <li> Restart states are automatically dumped prior to 
                        actioning any intervention in a running suite.</li>

                        <li> Spin-up processing by insertion
                        of temporary tasks and addition of new 
                        prerequisites on the fly.</li>

                        <li> Recursive purge: remove an entire sub-tree
                        of tasks through to some future cycle time.

                        <li> Conditional prerequisites (triggers).</li>

                        <li> Task families.</li>

                        <li> Task retry for automated failure recovery.</li>

                        <li> Central alerting and timeouts for operational suites.</li>

                        <li> Portable suites are easy to construct -
                        just copy another user's suite and run it.</li>

                        <li> Simulation mode: get the scheduling right,
                        on an accelerated clock, without running 
                        real tasks.</li>

				</ul>

			<h4><span>Coming Soon</span></h4>
				<ul>
						<li> Central suite database access via a network server. </li>
                        <li> Tasks with cycling intervals of less than 1 hour 
                        (in development).</li>
						<li> Asynchronous tasks for processing satellite passes 
						(back-port from prototype in cylc-2).
						</li>
                        <li> Loose prerequisites: trigger off the "most
                        recent available" (variable offset) instance of
                        a slower-cycling upstream task (back-port from
                        cylc-2).</li>

                        <li> Initiate and populate the GitHub cylc repository issue tracker.</li>

            <p class="p1"><span>
                Cylc uses the powerful <a href="git-scm.com">Git</a>
                distributed source code management system.  The 
                <a href="http://github.com/hjoliver/cylc">cylc master repository</a> 
                is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
            </span></p>

            <p class="p2"><span>
                To develop a new feature (or fix a bug, etc.) collaborators should:
                <ol>
                    <li> Fork (clone) the cylc master repository on GitHub</li>
                    <li> Clone a local copy of their cylc fork on GitHub</li>
                    <li> Develop and test their changes in a new branch of their repository</li>
                    <li> Merge in any new master repository changes and resolve any conflicts</li>
                    <li> Push their changes back to their cylc fork on GitHub</li>
                    <li> Send a pull request to Hilary Oliver</li>
                </ol>
                Hilary Oliver (the master repository maintainer) can then:
                <ol>
                    <li> fetch the new branch to the master repository</li>
                    <li> review the changes</li>
                    <li> merge them into the cylc trunk for future releases</li>

                This model applies specifically to a top tier of
                official collaborators. There can be lower tiers of
                development, e.g. within a particular organisation, that
                only interact directly with their associated
                cylc collaborator repository (although there is nothing
                to stop anybody from easily collaborating with anybody
