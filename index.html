   <p class="p1"><span> Cylc has been developed to date mainly by Dr
   Hilary James Oliver at <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">NIWA</a> 
        (National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research,
        New Zealand). It was prototyped in 2008, has controlled NIWA's
        operational forecasting systems since 2010, and was
        released under the GNU General Public License in 2011.</span></p>

				<div class="warning">NEW 3 Nov 2011: cylc-4.0.0-rc3 released.</div>

    <a id="overview"></a>
    <h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

    <p class="p1"><span>A metascheduler, in this context, is a
    <em>control system</em> that determines when interdependent tasks
    are ready to execute (usually by submission to a batch queue
        scheduler). Cylc does this for suites of <em>cycling</em> tasks,
        although it can also handle non-cycling (one-off) tasks, and
        repeating asynchronous tasks for processing data from successive
        satellite passes in real time.</span></p>
        
    <p class="p2"><span>
        Dependence between tasks in different forecast cycles can
        be ignored in real time operation, but this severely
        restricts scheduling after delays when it should be
        possible to run tasks from multiple cycles at once. Even  
        <a href="intro-graphics/dep-one-cycle.png">simple suites</a> appear
        <a href="intro-graphics/dep-multi-cycle.png">complicated</a>
        when intercycle dependence is taken into account (a, b, and c
        represent warm-cycled forecast models). Cylc's self-organising
        scheduling algorithm solves this problem, and as a result it can
        optimally interleave tasks from multiple forecast cycles
        whenever the opportunity arises, potentially achieving 
        <a href="intro-graphics/timeline-three.png">very fast catch up from delays</a> 
        (cylc on top) even in resource limited operations with little
        down time between cycles. The same goes for
        <a href="intro-graphics/timeline-two.png">processing historical data</a>
        (cylc on top) or running parallel test suites that start behind
        the main operation.
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc also has very flexible, adaptive run time behaviour:
        suites naturally transition between delayed and real time
        operation as required; they adapt to insertion and removal of
        tasks; and they flow around failed or delayed tasks (which
        catch up as quickly as possible once the problem is addressed).
    </span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span>
        Cylc's suite design paradigm is simple and intuitive: 
        "draw" a dependency graph in concise textual form, then
        configure the runtime properties of each task. This simple 
        <a href="screenshots/simple-suiterc.png">suite definition</a>,
        for example, defines a suite with this
<a href="screenshots/QuickStartB-graph18.png">dependency graph</a>.
        Large suites <a href="screenshots/ecox-1.png">like this</a> are
        no more difficult, they just have more tasks.

            <p class="p1"><span>First, see the <a href="#overview">Overview</a> above.</span></p>
				<ul>
                        <li> Cylc can handle many 
                        <b>hundreds of tasks</b> in a single suite (see 
                        <a href="#performance">performance)</a>.</li>

                        <li> <b>Suite tasks can be distributed</b> across multiple
                        hosts on a heterogeneous network, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> <b>Most existing tasks require no modification for cylc.</b> </li>

            <li> <b>Suites are validated</b>, to catch most errors prior to run time.</li>
	
                        <li> Self-documenting <b>command line</b> and
                        <b>graphical interfaces</b> covering all functionality.</li>

                        <li> <b>Cryptographic suite security:</b> users cannot 
                        intervene in the operation of suites owned by others.</li>

                        <li> <b>Submit single tasks</b> exactly as the suite would
                        (job submission method and execution environment).</li>

                        <li> A <b>lockserver</b> prevents accidental invocation
                        of multiple instances of a suite or task at the same time.</li>

                        <li> <b>Suite databases</b> enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

                        <li> <b>Suites adapt to insertion and removal of tasks at run time.</b></li>
                        <li> <b>Suites flow around failed or delayed tasks.</b></li>

                        from a previous state.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of

                        <li> Restart states are automatically dumped prior to 
                        actioning any intervention in a running suite.</li>

                        <li> Spin-up processing by insertion
                        of temporary tasks and addition of new

                        <li> <b>Task families</b> (for common runtime properties and for triggering).</li>

				<h3 class="foo"><span>Performance</span></h3>

                <p class="p2">As of version 3.2.0 cylc can easily manage
                1000 tasks in single suite. Beyond several hundred tasks
                the suite control GUIs may struggle - they have not yet
                been optimized for huge suites; for now you can run very
                large suites using cylc command line control and
                monitoring tools.</p>

Python and Pyro are essential. PyGTK is required by the gcylc GUI

            <h3><span>Development</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>
                Cylc uses the powerful <a href="git-scm.com">Git</a>
                distributed source code management system.  Git makes
                branching and merging, forking/cloning, and pushing and
                pulling changes between repositories very easy. The 
                <a href="http://github.com/hjoliver/cylc">cylc master repository</a> 
                is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
            </span></p>

            <p class="p2"><span>
                At this stage we envision using the 
                <em>fork and pull</em> model
            of collaborative development. Anyone can fork the cylc 
            repository on GitHub (or just locally) and push changes to
            their personal fork (or just work in their local clone)
            without requiring write access to the master repository. The
            changes must then be pulled into the
            source repository, reviewed, and merged, by the project
            maintainer. Thus we avoid the overhead, and potential problems, 
            of managing permissions for multiple users and many personal
            branches within the one repository, and without restricting
            development (because everyone gets their own fully
            functional cylc repository).
            </span></p>

            <p class="p3"><span>
                Ultimately, to reduce the burden of maintainance on the
                master repository, we could have a top tier of official
                forks that the project maintainer collaborates with 
                directly, and others below, perhaps within specific cylc
                sites, that interact with the official collaborators. 
                (But note that if circumstances warrant, anybody can
                easily and safely collaborate with anybody else using
                git, given read access to their respective repositories).

The cylc codebase assumes Unix-style file paths in places, but it could
easily made more portable if necessary.

<li> <a id="fn2" href="#fnr2" title="This is a footnote; return to main text.">(back)</a> Python 2.4 was released in November 2004. Python 3 is the future of
Python, but it is not backward compatible with 2.x and consequently
still has significantly less library and third party support.  As of mid
2011, Python 2.7 is still the standard for new Linux distributions.

<li> <a id="fn3" href="#fnr3" title="This is a footnote; return to main text.">(back)</a>
As of April 2011, Pyro 4, which is compatible with Python 3, is in
development but it is still not recommended for production use.
