            <p class="p1"><span>Cylc (pronounced <em>silk</em>) is an advanced
								metascheduler for cycling weather and
								environmental forecasting systems.</span></p>

            <p class="p2"><span> Cylc makes it easy to construct and  
                control powerful, portable, suites for numerical
                forecasting and related processing. It has been
                developed by Dr Hilary James Oliver at NIWA (the
                National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research,
                New Zealand) since 2008, and was released as free open
                source software under the terms of the GNU GPL in 2011.

			<h3><span>Overview</span></h3>

            <!--<p class="p2"><span>Environmental forecasting suites may
                contain many scientific models and associated data
                processing tasks that each repeat on some interval, or
                <em>forecast cycle</em> (which may vary by task). 
                The dependencies between tasks form a tree-like Directed
								Acyclic Graph.</span></p> -->

						<!-- <p class="p1"><span> Forecasting metaschedulers have
								traditionally ignored dependencies between tasks in 
								different forecast cycles, such as the restart
								dependencies of warm cycled models, because (a) they
								create a complicated never-ending dependency graph 
								instead of the familiar sequence of distinct cycles;
								and (b) they are satisfied implicitly in normal real
								time operation when each cycle necessarily completes
								before the next starts. But this <em>requires</em> 
								whole-suite sequential cycling, in order to avoid
								dependency violations, even in delayed operation when
								the driving data for the next cycle are available in
								advance. This is at best inefficient, and for
								resource-limited operations that have little down time
								between cycles it can result in long catchup times and
								cycle overruns. </span></p> -->


								<p class="p1"><span>Cylc decides when members of a suite
										of interdependent cycling tasks are ready to
                                        be submitted to a scheduler to be queued for
                                        execution. Its self-organising
                                        scheduling algorithm, which
										explicitly manages dependencies between as well as
										within forecast cycles, allows it to optimally
								interleave tasks from multiple cycles without violating
								dependencies, potentially achieving very fast catchup
								from delays even in resource limited operations with
								little down time between cycles.  Cylc suites
								organically transition between delayed and real time
								operation as required; they adapt to insertion and
								removal of tasks at run time; and they flow around
								failed or delayed tasks while problems are addressed -
								after which the delayed tasks catch up as quickly as
								possible.  </span></p>


			<h3><span>An Illustration</span></h3>

            <p class="p1"><span>Intercycle dependencies can usually be
                ignored in real time
            operation, but this places severe restrictions on what can
            be done in catchup/delayed (or case study) operation. Even
            simple suites
            <a href="intro/dep-one-cycle.png">like this one</a> become
            complicated <a href="intro/dep-multi-cycle.png">like this</a> 
            (tasks a, b, and c are warm cycled forecast models)
            when all dependencies are taken into account. 
            Cylc's self-organizing algorithm handles this with ease,
            however, achieving optimal scheduling in
            all states of operation as shown in
            <a href="intro/timeline-three.png">this job schedule</a> 
            (cylc is above the time line). As a side
            effect, cylc also has very flexible adaptive run time
            behaviour. See the introductory section of the User
            Guide for a more detailed discussion.

			<h3><span>Notable Features</span></h3>
				<ul>
                        <li> Tasks can be distributed across multiple
                        heterogeneous hosts, with multiple job
                        submission methods.</li>

                        <li> Most existing models and processing jobs
                        can be used without modification as cylc
                        tasks.</li>

                        <li>Simple, structured, intuitive suite
                        definition: "draw"
                        a dependency graph in concise textual form, and
                        configure the execution environment and command
                        line for each task.

            <li>Suite definitions are automatically validated against a
            comprehensive specification.</li>
	
						<li> Self-documenting unified command line interface
						covering all functionality from suite editing,
						searching, graphing, and validation; to 
						interrogation and suite control.</li>

						<li> Graphical interfaces covering the same, including 
						a graph-based suite control interface. See screen shots.</li>

                        <li> Crypographic suite security - prevents users from 
                        accidentally or maliciously intervening in the operation
                        of suite's owned by others.</li>

						<li> Run single tasks exactly as the suite would run them </li>

						<li> A network lockserver to prevent accidental invocation 
						of multiple instances of the same suite or task at the same
						time.</li>

						<li> Suite databases to enable sharing of suites among
						users.</li>

						<li> Suites can be stopped and restarted in any state of
						operation. </li>

                        <li> Insertion and deletion of tasks at run time</li>

                        <li> Recursive purge: remove an entire sub-tree
                        of tasks through to some future cycle time.

                        <li> Conditional prerequisites </li>

                        <li> Task families </li>

                        <li> Central alerting and timeouts for operational suites </li>

                        <li> Portable suites: copy and run</li>

                        <li> Simulation mode: get the scheduling right,
                        on an accelerated clock, without running the
                        real tasks</li>

				</ul>

			<h3><span>Coming Soon</span></h3>
				<ul>
						<li> Network server access to the central suite database</li>
						<li> Tasks with cycling intervals of less than 1 hour</li>
						<li> Asynchronous tasks for processing satellite passes 
						(back port from prototype in cylc-2).
