<!--l. 3932--><p class="noindent" >The graph-based suite control GUI has the advantage that it shows the structure of a suite very clearly as it evolves.
It works remarkably well even for very large suites, on the order of one hundred tasks or more <span 
class="cmti-10">but </span>on the downside,
the graphviz engine does a new global optimization every time the graph changes, so the layout is often not very
stable. This may or may not be a solvable problem - it seems likely that making continual incremental changes to
an existing graph without redoing the global layout would inevitably result in some kind of horrible
mess.
</p><!--l. 3942--><p class="indent" >   The following features of the graph-based control GUI go a long way toward mitigating the changing layout
problem:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The disconnect button can be used to temporarily prevent the graph from changing as the content of
     the suite changes (and in real time operation suites evolve quite slowly anyway)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Right-click on a task and choose the &#8220;Focus&#8221; option to restrict the graph display to that task&#8217;s cycle
     time. Anything interesting happening in other cycles will show up as disconnected rectangular nodes
     to the right of the graph (and you can click on those to intantly refocus to their cycles).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Task filtering is the ultimate quick route to temporarily focusing on just the tasks you&#8217;re interested in
     (but this will destroy the graph structure, to state the obvious).</li></ul>
<!--l. 3959--><p class="indent" >   In future cylc releases we plan to keep the graph centered, after layout changes, on the most recently clicked-on
task.
