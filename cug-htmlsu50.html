<!--l. 4509--><p class="noindent" >As a suite runs its tasks (or rather the task proxies that represent the real tasks) move through a series of defined
states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">waiting </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">waiting </span>task&#8217;s prerequisites have not yet been satisfied (clock-triggered tasks may also be
     waiting on their trigger time).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">queued </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">queued </span>task is ready to run but has been temporarily prevented from doing so by the
     internal cylc queue to which it is assigned (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Internal Queues</span>, Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="cug-htmlsu51.html#x76-14000011.2.2">11.2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: InternalQueues --></a>). Note this does mean
     the task is sitting in an external batch scheduler queue (that, depending on the chosen job submission
     method, would be the <span 
class="cmti-10">submitted </span>state).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">submitted </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">submitted </span>task has been submitted by its defined job submission method but has not yet
     started executing (it may be waiting in an external batch scheduler queue, depending on job submission
     method).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">running </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">running </span>task has started executing (reported via a messaging call near the top of the task
     job script) but has not yet finished.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">two finished states:
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">succeeded </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">succeeded  </span>task has finished successfully. It will remain in the suite so long as its
         outputs could be needed to satisfy the prerequisites of waiting tasks, and then it will be removed
         from the suite.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
         </li>
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">failed </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">failed </span>task has aborted after reporting failure. Failed tasks are not automatically removed
         from the suite, they must be handled by the suite operator (e.g.&#x00A0;by retriggering after fixing the
         problem).</li></ul>
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 4549--><p class="indent" >   In addition, there are two held (paused) task states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">held </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">held </span>task will not be submitted, even if it is ready to run, until it is released. Tasks that are
     already running cannot be held. The suite operator can deliberately hold tasks, and cylc itself puts
     tasks on hold under certain circumstances. For example, if the suite has been told to &#8220;shut down after
     currently running tasks have finished&#8221; waiting tasks will be put on hold while currently running tasks
     are finishing.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">runahead </span>- a task in the <span 
class="cmti-10">runahead </span>state has exceeded the suite runahead limit, i.e.&#x00A0;it has got &#8220;too
     far ahead&#8221; of the slowest tasks and will be held back until they have caught up sufficiently. This state
     is automatically managed by cylc. See <span 
class="cmti-10">The Suite Runahead Limit</span>, Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="cug-htmlsu51.html#x76-13900011.2.1">11.2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: RunaheadLimit --></a>.
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 4570--><p class="indent" >   Finally, you may see references to the following pseudo states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">ready </span>- to set a task to <span 
class="cmti-10">ready </span>means to set all of its prerequisites satisfied - i.e.&#x00A0;ready to run (except
     clock-triggered tasks, which also wait on a trigger time).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">base </span>(Graph Control GUI only) - off-white base color graph nodes are displayed in order to show the
     proper graph structure but the corresponding task proxies are not actually present in the suite, because
     they have not been spawned yet, or they have been removed by cylc as spent tasks, or removed by the
     suite operator.</li></ul>
