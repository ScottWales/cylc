TO BE DOCUMENTED:

* Task retry via command list is currently only documented in the
  Suite.rc Reference appendix.

* note 'cylc submit SUITE foo%T' results in T being adjusted to the next
  nearest valid cycle time for the task, as defined by the graph. 

* cold start prerequisites are ignored if the initial cycle time is not 
  a valid hour for the task (intentional: consider 00Z RCF task in nzlam).

* if a suite is restarted on a new port the gui still reconnects to the
  correct suite.

* inlined suite.rc: avoid comments ending in line continuation marker
  (Feb 2012 - still valid?)

* task insertion danger: if you insert task A(T+N) ahead of A(T),
  the suite will shut down if A(T) catches up with A(T+N): 'task has 
  already registered its outputs'

* can't restart early in a coldstart: restart will not be recognized as
  a coldstart.

* deleting a task may allow the suite to move on to the point that the
  deleted task, if reinserted, will not get its prerequisites satisfied
  automatically.

* Why the need for different spawning behaviour of sequential tasks?
  Because relying on self-dependence, foo[T-6] => foo[T], would require
  all sequential tasks to be bootstrapped in a cold start.
