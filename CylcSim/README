A small test server and client programs to simulate cylc's main loop and
Pyro request handling behavior - will use to improve responsiveness to
requests (task messages and user commands) even with long task pool
processing times. Preliminary results: switch to mult-threaded Pyro!
It may also be worth calling handleRequest() multiple times (until a
timeout) before processing tasks (but this may not be necessary
with multithreaded pyro...). More soon ...
